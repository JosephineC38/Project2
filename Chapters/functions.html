      <h1> Functions <h1>
      <p> A function is a set of instructions for the code to execute. A typical function looks like this. </p>
        <img src = "/Pictures/functionWithPara.png">

      <p> However, it doesn't have to have parameters. It can also be blank. Here is an example of a function that prints "Hello World" to the console log. Try to type it in. </p>
        <img src = "/Pictures/helloFunction.png">

        <p> Nothing happened? Functions can't be executed without a function call. It's useful if you don't want to execute code immediately. So, let's call the function using hello(). </p>
        <img src = "/Pictures/helloCall.png">

        <p> Did you call it? This should be the result. </p>

         <img src = "/Pictures/helloRun.png">

        <p> Here are some tips </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li> Give your function a simple name. Don't let it be called changeACatIntoAnEvenCuterCat(). You have to type that each time. Instead, name it changeCat(). </li>
          <li> Always remmeber to add parathesis. </li>  
        </ul>
