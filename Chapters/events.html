      <h1> Events </h1>

    <p> It is a bright morning and you waiting for the train. When the train arrives, you walk inside and find a seat. In Javascript terms: </p>
      <br>
    
      <p> Event: Train Arrival 
      <br>
      Reaction: Finding a seat.
      </p>

      HTML pages are dirven by events and Javascript can react upon those events. Some HTML events include an button was clicked or a web page has finished loading. Let's attempt to code one event now. 
    </p>

    <h2> onclick </h2>

    <p> Remember in Getting Started, there was a button to change the cat picture? Here is the HTML. </p>

    <img src="/Pictures/events/changeCat.png" alt="changeCat() function">

     <p> The event for a button is called <strong> onclick </strong> It allows me to change the cat picture using my function. Here, the button responds to clicking the button. </p>

     <h2> onload </h2>
    <p> It will execute a Javascript function  immediately after the object has loaded. </p>

    <img src="/Pictures/events/onload.png" alt="onload">
    <br>
    <img src="/Pictures/events/onloadFun.png" alt="load() function">
    <p> The object is the body and it will print "Page has loaded" onto the console after the page has...loaded. </p>

    <p> That's just the tip of the iceberg, check out w3schools' <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp"> HTML Events </a> for a more extensive list. </p>
