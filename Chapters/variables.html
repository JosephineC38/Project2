      <h1> Variables </h1>

    <p> To start, play a game of <a href="https://flappybird.io/"> Flappy Bird </a> . Hopefully you aren't that good with it. Now that you are done, what do you notice each time you pass a pipe?

    <p> Your score increase by one. That's because your score is a variable. A <strong> variable </strong> can store reuseable values. They can anything from the number of steps you walked or your favorite flavor of ice cream (obviously Rocky Road). There are several wyas you can initialize a variable. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> const</li>
      <li> let </li>  
      <li> var </li>  
    </ul>

    <p> <strong> const </strong> should be used if the value or type shouldn't be changed. </p>

    <p> <strong> let </strong> should only be used if you can't use const </p>

    <p> <strong> var </strong> is a local variable should only be used to support old browsers. A local varible can only exist within the funtion it was created in. That means the same name can be used in.  </p>
