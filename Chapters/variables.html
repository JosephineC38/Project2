  <h1> Variables </h1>

  <p> To start, play a game of <a href="https://flappybird.io/"> Flappy Bird </a> . Hopefully you aren't that good with
    it. Now that you are done, what do you notice each time you pass a pipe?
  </p>

  <p> Your score increase by one. That's because your score is a variable. A variable can store
    reuseable values. They can anything from the number of steps you walked or your favorite flavor of ice cream
    (obviously Rocky Road). There are several ways you can initialize a variable. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> const</li>
    <li> let </li>
    <li> var </li>
  </ul>

  <p> const should be used if the value or type shouldn't be changed. </p>

  <p> let should only be used if you can't use const </p>

  <p> var is a local variable that should only be used to support old browsers. A local variable can only
    exist within the function it was created in. That means the same name can be used in multiple functions.

  <p> Note that it's best practice to declare varibles before use. </p>
