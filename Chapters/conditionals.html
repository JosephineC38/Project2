      <h1> Conditionals <h1>
      <p> On Monday, it's raining and you don't want to get wet. So, you wear a raincoat. <br>
        On Tuesday it's snowing so you wear a snow coat. <br>
        On Wednesday, it's sunny so you wear a tank top. <br>
        On Thursday, it's cloudy so you wear a shirt. <br>
        On Friday, there is no weather, so you wear a shirt. <br>
        For each action, you are reacting differently. In Javascript, it can visualized like this: </p>
        <img src = "/Pictures/conditionals/weather.png" alt = "weather conditions">


        <p> But what do these statements mean? </p>
        <p> An <strong> if </strong> statement will execute a block of code if the condition is true. </p>
         <img src = "/Pictures/conditionals/ifNumIs1.png" alt = "if statement is true">
         <img src = "/Pictures/conditionals/ifNumIs2.png" alt = "if statement is false">


        <p> If you want to test multiple statements, use an <strong> else if </strong > statement. It will execute a different block of code if the first condition is false. </p>
        <img src = "/Pictures/conditionals/elseifNumIs2.png">

        <p> If all the condtions you tested are false, use an <strong> else </strong > statement. It's a catch all statement </p>
